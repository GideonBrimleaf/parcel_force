# Parcel Force

A simple React app to demonstrate the viability of using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/recipes/react/) rather than [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) for React development. This allows us to start from scratch rather than tinker with pre-existing files.

To start in dev:

```
npm install
npx parcel index.html
```

Navigate to `localhost:1234`

To run the linter:

```
npx eslint index.js src/**
```

To deploy to Firebase - follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/niksseif/d86c4a3c05e2f3ca834a4c09152024ca)
